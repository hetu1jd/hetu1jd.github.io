									<p>Ximena Martinez - Previous Co-Worker</p>
									<li>John is an incredibly easy going and collaborative teammate. He always goes the extra mile to proactively share relevant marketing learnings and updates. 
										I appreciate Johnâ€™s thoughtful approach to 
										digital marketing and recommend him highly for any position or team that requires deep knowledge of paid search and social best practices and strategy.</li>

									<p>Eleni Konstas - Previous Leader</p>
									<li>Soft spoken and inquisitive, John and I worked on separate teams for the last year before he hopped into the fray on my team, taking on several of my accounts, earlier this summer. He brought new ideas and perspectives to his accounts, as well as reliable day to day management. He frequently went above and beyond, including once producing the entire team report solo! John often asks quiet and critical questions, helping to raise the bar on the work we do as a team and helping my own work grow. As a fellow Jon Loomer fan, John is always aware to be thinking of the next step. Any team would be lucky to have him.</li>
